# DESQ Matlab Code

Introduction
-----------------------------------------------
The outer most layer of the tear film consists of lipid layer. When it is equally illuminated and observed through a slit lamp it shows some interference pattern. 
Depending upon the color constituents of the lipid layer the irregularities and thickness of the lipid layer can be quantified and visualised using the 3D mesh generated by the code.

## Prerequisites
- MATLAB
- Image Processing Basics

## Steps to execute the code:
- Change the image's path at line 20 in file Gen3DLipidLayer.m
- Run the code in MATLAB
- Visualise the mesh using the Rotate 3D icon
